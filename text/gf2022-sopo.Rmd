## Highlights

<!-- * We summarized groundfish stock status as of 2021 by (1) gathering time series of stock assessment output, (2) fitting -->
<!--   a hierarchical Bayesian time-series model to them, and (3) joining model-based survey indices with assessed biomass to -->
<!--   illustrate how surveyed population trends have changed subsequent to the -->
<!--   stock assessments. -->

<!-- * We assembled estimated biomass (B) time series from stock assessments for 24 -->
<!--   Pacific Canadian groundfish stocks and modelled average and stock status -->
<!--   through 2021 based on biomass relative to each stock's (1) Limit Reference -->
<!--   Point (B/LRP), (2) Upper Stock Reference (B/USR), and (3) biomass at maximum -->
<!--   sustainable yield (B/B~MSY~). -->

<!-- * The overall mean B/LRP in 2021 was **3.2** (95% credible interval [CI]: -->
<!--   **2.6--3.9**) . The overall mean B/USR and B/B~MSY~ in 2021 was **1.5** (95% CI: -->
<!--   **1.3--1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1--1.7)**, respectively. -->

<!-- * Average stock status declined from 1950 to around 2000 and has remained -->
<!--   relatively stable since then. The change around 2000 followed the -->
<!--   implementation of ITQs (individual transferable quotas) for the trawl fleet -->
<!--   and the commencement of the synoptic trawl surveys. -->

* Average groundfish stock status declined from 1950 to around 2000 and has remained relatively stable since then. The change around 2000 followed the implementation of ITQs (individual transferable quotas) for the trawl fleet and the commencement of the synoptic trawl surveys.

* As of their last assessment, three stocks (Strait of Georgia Lingcod [Area 4B] and inside and outside Quillback Rockfish) had a $>$ 5% probability of being below their Limit Reference Point. Conversely, two-thirds of assessed stocks had a high (\>75%) probability of being in the "healthy zone".

* All assessed shelf rockfish (Bocaccio, Canary, Redstripe, Silvergray, Widow,  Yellowtail) and several slope rockfish increased in surveyed biomass over the last ~5 years. Surveyed biomass for several flatfish (Petrale, English, Rex, and Dover Sole) increased over the last 5–10 years but declined for Arrowtooth Flounder.

* Survey indices for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish stocks had the steepest declines across all stocks---particularly for inside Vancouver Island waters in 2021.

## Introduction

DFO conducts a suite of randomized surveys using bottom trawl, longline hook, and longline trap gear that, in aggregate, cover Canada's Pacific Coast [@anderson2019].
Synoptic trawl surveys in Queen Charlotte Sound (Areas 5A and 5B) and Hecate Strait (Areas 5C and 5D) are conducted in odd numbered years, while the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI; Areas 3C and 3D) and the West Coast of Haida Gwaii (WCHG; Area 5E) surveys are conducted in even numbered years.
In addition, four biennial Hard Bottom Longline (HBLL) surveys are conducted, two in "inside" waters (east of Vancouver Island; Area 4B) and two in "outside" waters (everywhere else).
Lastly, a coast-wide longline trap survey targeting sablefish is conducted every year and DFO collects biological information from the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Setline Survey.
In 2021, in addition to the usual odd numbered year surveys, the synoptic WCVI trawl survey and inside HBLL south surveys were conducted to make up for missing them in 2020 due to COVID-19.
At the time of writing, the outside HBLL data are not yet available in DFO's survey databases.
<!-- These surveys provide much of the data (survey indexes, ages, lengths, maturities) to reconstruct plausible stock trajectories and estimate reference points. -->


Assessment scientists conduct regular stock assessment for major fish stocks in BC.
These assessments combine fishery-dependent data (such as commercial catches) with fishery-independent data (data from scientific surveys) to estimate quantities such as spawning stock biomass, growth and maturity, and derive measures of fishing intensity and stock status.
Stock status is typically assessed with respect to two reference points: (1) the Limit Reference Point (LRP), a "status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock"; and (2) the Upper Stock Reference Point (USR), which represents the "threshold below which removals must be progressively reduced in order to avoid reaching the LRP".
<!-- Assessments are usually ‘tuned’ to fit survey indices well; however, assessments also account for gear ‘selectivity’, like the fact that smaller fish are not captured by certain gear. -->
While stock assessments represent the gold-standard of estimated trends in population status, assessments are time and labour intensive and therefore frequently lag behind high quality datasets such as indices of abundance from scientific surveys, which often closely reflect population trends from assessments.
Geostatistical spatiotemporal models allow spatially adjacent areas surveyed in various years to be combined into single annual indices that can help track changes in surveyed abundance between assessments.

This year, we explored population trends for groundfish stocks using two methods: (1) we updated a hierarchical Bayesian state-space time-series model from last year [@anderson2021sopopreprint] to explore trends until the year 2021, and (2) we developed model-based indices from relevant surveys for all assessed stocks, as well as stocks with outstanding requests for Science Advice.

<!-- This model incorporated uncertainty in stock-specific status; and (2) we projected the latent underlying stock-specific status forward to the last year (2021). -->
<!-- The latter accounts for not all stocks having an up-to-date stock assessment and accounts for future possible stock states based on the time-series properties of the fitted stock trajectories. -->

## Methods

We gathered Bayesian posterior distributions of estimated biomass from assessments for `r nrow(refs)` stocks, including five updated assessments (Yellomouth Rockfish coastwide stock, Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish south and north stocks, Pacific Cod 5ABCD and 3CD stocks).
We did not have access to the updated Bocaccio assessment data [@dfo2022bocaccio] at the time of writing and so include the projection from [@dfo2022bocaccio].
From these distributions, we modelled overall (i.e., all stocks combined) mean log stock status as a latent random walk with individual stocks assumed to have an auto-regressive observation model with their 'true' status drawn from their stock-assessed posterior distribution.
The approach is an extension of a model in @hilborn2020 to include uncertainty on stock status and implement the model in Stan [@carpenter2017]; details are available in @anderson2021sopopreprint.

<!-- ```{r, results='asis'} -->
<!-- csasdown::csas_table(refs, col.names = c("Stock", "Reference"), caption = "Assessed groundfish stocks included in the analysis with associated data reference.", longtable = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, include=FALSE}
surv_dat <- readRDS(here::here("data-generated/assess-index-plotted-data.rds"))
```

For these `r nrow(refs)` stocks, as well as stocks with outstanding requests for Science Advice, and stocks with assessments that lacked the necessary posterior distributions for inclusion in the above model, we selected the relevant surveys (`r nrow(surv_dat)` total stocks).
We combined regional surveys that used the same gear and protocols (e.g., north and south outside HBLL surveys, or various synoptic trawl surveys).
We then fit geostatistical models of biomass density with TMB [@kristensen2016] via the R package sdmTMB [@anderson2022].
These models accounted for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random field and allowed spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a Guassian random field random walk.
For each stock--survey type combination, we fit both Tweedie and delta-gamma (binomial and gamma) observation error models and reported the model that produced the most precise index estimates on average; for most stocks (~80%), this was the delta-gamma model.
We then predicted and summed biomass or abundance density across the appropriate 2 x 2km survey grid(s) [e.g., @anderson2019] and scaled the survey index to the existing stock assessment biomass trend based on the geometric mean in overlapping years.
Data and code to reproduce our analysis are available at <https://github.com/pbs-assess/gftrends>.

<!-- Across all stocks, there was a decline in average stock status until approximately 2000 (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-framework)). -->

<!-- The USR defines the breakpoint between the healthy and cautious zone and the LRP defines the breakpoint between the cautious and critical zone. -->
<!-- The LRP and USR are often calculated based on B~MSY~ (biomass at maximum sustainable yield) at provisional levels of 0.4 B~MSY~ and 0.8 B~MSY~, but in other cases can be based on proxies, such as average or minimum historical biomass levels [e.g., @forrest2020pcod]. -->

<!-- If space is an issue for the SOPO version of this, I still think Figure 1 could be left out and last years report cited. We could keep the stats. -->
Across all stocks, there was a decline in average stock status until approximately 2000 (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-framework)).
The late 1990s and early 2000s marked the beginning of a relatively stable average status.
We estimated the overall mean B/LRP (biomass divided by the LRP) in 2021 to be `r make_quant_text(q2021lrp)`.
The overall mean B/USR and B/B~MSY~ (biomass divided by biomass at maximum sustainable yield) in 2021 was `r make_quant_text(q2021usr)` and `r make_quant_text(q2021msy)`, respectively (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-framework), \@ref(fig:ridges)).
<!-- I think this effect is too small to need to mention. -->
<!-- Uncertainty in average status in recent years increased slightly because not all stocks had a current assessment (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-framework)). -->
<!-- This uncertainty can be partially address using survey indices to extend our exploration of stock status to the most recent year with survey data. -->
Despite the overall pattern in the average biological status, there was considerable variation within and across individual stocks, especially when recent survey trends are also considered (Figure \@ref(fig:stock-vs-indices)).

Estimated biomass was above the LRP and USR for most stocks as of the most recent assessment (Figure \@ref(fig:ridges)).
Of the stocks with full posterior distributions available, 4B Lingcod was the only stock with $>$ 5% posterior density below its LRP as of its most recent assessment (Figure \@ref(fig:ridges)).
Coastwide Bocaccio had $>$ 5% posterior density below the LRP in 2020 [@dfo2020bocaccio] but effectively 0% by 2021 after a large recruitment cohort in 2016 [@dfo2022bocaccio].
Quillback Rockfish in both outside and inside waters had $>$ 5% posterior density below their LRPs as of the 2011 assessment, but the full posterior distribution was not available (quantiles shown in Figure \@ref(fig:stock-vs-indices)).
Pacific Cod in 3CD had a `r round(refpt$p_lrp[refpt$stock_clean == "Pacific Cod 3CD"], 2)` probability B $<$ LRP in 2020.
Considering the USR instead of the LRP, `r sum(refpt$p_usr > 0.25)`/`r nrow(refpt)` of the stocks in Figure \@ref(fig:ridges) had \> 25% probability of being below their USR as of their most recent assessment.
<!-- Pacific Cod and Walleye Pollock both have a shorter generation time compared to many other stocks here, and have both exhibited strong patterns of decadal variation. -->

When we used survey indices to explore more recent changes across species, additional patterns emerged.
Survey indices for all assessed shelf rockfish (Bocaccio, Canary, Redstripe, Silvergray, Widow, Yellowtail), and some slope rockfish (e.g., Yellowmouth) increased in the past ~5 years (Figure \@ref(fig:stock-vs-indices)).
The survey indices also allowed us to explore surveyed population trends of species that have not yet received full assessments, such as many flatfish and Chondrichthyans.
Most of the included flatfish (Petrale, English, Rex, Dover) appeared to increase in survey biomass over the last 5--10 years.
However, the trawl survey index suggested that Arrowtooth Flounder have declined since the last assessment (Figure \@ref(fig:stock-vs-indices)).
Trends among the skates generally appeared stable or positive.
North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (herein 'dogfish') stocks, however, experienced the steepest declines of all stocks (Figure \@ref(fig:stock-vs-indices)), with a particularly steep decline in inside Vancouver Island waters in 2021.

## Factors influencing trends

The longterm overall groundfish trend is likely to have been primarily influenced by fishery removals and management interventions.
<!-- TODO: Do you want to repeat any of this from last year? -->
The transition from declining average B/LRP and B/USR to a relatively stable trajectory coincided with the implementation of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) for the trawl fleet, the introduction of 100% at-sea observer coverage over the period 1992--1997 [@turris2000], and the initiation of the current synoptic trawl surveys in 2003.
Furthermore, ITQs and electronic at-sea monitoring were introduced into the longline and trap fisheries in 2006 [@stanley2015].
<!-- Following these major management changes, quota for many stocks has remained relatively constant over the last two decades [@dfo2019ifmp]. -->
<!-- The decadal patterns in assessed status for Pacific Cod [@forrest2020pcod] and Walleye Pollock [@starr2021pollock] in early decades are largely driven by trends in commercial catches and catch per unit effort. -->

Other patterns may be driven by species interactions and climatic effects.
For example, dogfish are not currently heavily affected by any fishery, so the cause of their survey declines is unknown.
One possibility is that climate change is driving a northward range shift or that seasonal distribution patterns have changed as seen in the northwest Pacific Ocean [@Kanamori2022Dogfish].
For several species, there is evidence that temperature velocity---the pace a fish would have to move to maintain consistent temperature---may be related to a fine-scale redistribution of population density in Canadian Pacific waters [@english2021b].
Effects of recent oceanographic conditions on spawning habitat are hypothesized to have led to years of low recruitment in some groundfish [e.g., Pacific Cod in nearby Alaskan waters, @laurel2020].
On the other hand, after decades of consistently low recruitment, recent increases in several shelf rockfishes species---most notably Bocaccio---may in part by driven by transient availability of oxygen-rich water at depth during gestation [@schroeder2019; @dfo2022bocaccio].
<!-- Whatever the cause, increases in biomass density among several rockfishes suggests that many species may have benefited. -->

<!-- TODO: reword and acknowledge survey increases if including? -->
<!-- The slow recovery of Area 4B Lingcod since initial fishery-driven declines between the 1930s and 1980s may be a result of changes in the Strait of Georgia ecosystem [e.g., plankton timing, pinnipeds, @holt2016lingsog]. -->


## Implications of those trends

The Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* require that major fish stocks be maintained above their LRP with high probability.
Three stocks had $>$ 5% probability of being below their LRP as of their last assessment.
Roughly one-third of assessed stocks had $>$ 25% probability of being in the cautious zone where removals should be progressively reduced to avoid reaching the LRP.
Rebuilding and precautionary management of stocks in the critical and cautious zones, respectively, should help ensure stock status improves over time in response to reduced fishing pressure and favourable environmental conditions if and when they occur.
