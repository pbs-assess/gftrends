# Notes

* Add uncertainty on response
* Overall RW average
* Trend by flatfish rockfish etc.? Correlated random walks?
* Overall weighted equally or by biomass/catch?
* Kobe sliced by decade plot?
* Probability of increase or decline by decade?
* What to do about coastwide vs split up stocks?
* Gaussian process on x_t trend?
* Data coalition side benefit; get into a proper database?
* What to do when multiple scenarios per stock? Likely ensemble first?
* What about when MSE? Use OMs and ensemble first?
* Could also ensemble within the model, but adds some complexity and maybe doesnâ€™t add much
* But keep separate and ensembles in dataset?
* What other metadata needed? Keep minimal. ID (ResDoc/SAR?), species, reference ID, Type of model... look at RAM Legacy for ideas, but keep minimal.
